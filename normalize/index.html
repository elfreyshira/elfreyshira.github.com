      This is the coding challenge from Redfin. In the input box underneath, submit a path string, and the table below will display the normalized path. The code for the normalize method is available on <a href="https://github.com/elfreyshira/elfreyshira.github.com/blob/master/normalize/scripts.js#L21-53" target="_blank">my github account</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I know that in the challenge description, it was said that "foo//bar" should normalize to "foo//bar". However, I used regex to split the string between one or more slashes. Then at the end, I join each directory with a slash. It seemed like I would have to work backwards to make "foo//bar" normalize to "foo//bar". My function, instead, normalizes "foo//bar" to "foo/bar". I hope that, Redfin, a company that I believe is adaptive and understanding, would be okay with this alteration.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was very tempting not to overwork this coding challenge and go through all the possible normalization requirements. Here is a list of assumptions I made:
      <ul>
        <li>The directory names are valid as they are inputted.</li>
        <li>All path inputs are relative, instead of absolute.</li>
        <li>The path "foo/bar" is the same as "foo/bar/", so it's not necessary to strip the "/" at the end.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <form id="input-form">
      <input type="text" id="input-text" placeholder="File path">
      <input type="submit" value="Normalize">
    </form>
  </div>
  <table border="1" id="normalize-table">
    <tr>
      <th>
        Original File Path
      </th>
      <th>
        Normalized File Path
      </th>
    </tr>


  </table>
