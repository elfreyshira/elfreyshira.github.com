            Pi Tau Sigma is an international Mechanical Engineering Honor Society with core values of integrity, service, and leadership. Pi Tau Sigma invites the top 25% of the current junior class and the top 35% of the current senior class to join the organization. In addition to these class ranks, candidates must also be admitted into the Mechanical Engineering major sequence.

          <p>
            Texas Kappa is the Pi Tau Sigma chapter of the University of Texas at Austin. Under the sponsorship of Professor H.E. Degler, then chairman of the department, leading mechanical engineering students petitioned for a chapter in Pi Tau Sigma. The formal installation of Texas Kappa Chapter was held April 18, 1931, with National Secretary J. V. Manenis and Professor Degler officiating.
          </p>
          <p>
            Texas Kappa Chapter has cooperated with the Mechanical Engineering Department in its various functions. Each year the chapter presents to the highest ranking sophomore in the Mechanical Engineering Department an engineering handbook. Texas Kappa aids students in selection of an area of specialization by conducting block course discussions. The chapter's activities include social events for the Mechanical Engineering students. The chapter also cooperates with the student section of A.S.M.E. in carrying out various projects.

          <h1> History </h1>
          <p>
            Pi Tau Sigma came into being on March 16, 1915, at the University of Illinois. A similar organization embarked November 15, 1915, at Wisconsin. The two schools met together early in 1916 to make the honor society national, under the name of Pi Tau Sigma. The coalition took place in Chicago, March 12, 1916.
          </p>
          <p>
            To date, 167 chapters have been inducted into the organization throughout the United States with 157 still active. Pi Tau Sigma honors Mechanical engineering students who have exemplified the "principles of scholarship, character and service..." in the Mechanical engineering profession
