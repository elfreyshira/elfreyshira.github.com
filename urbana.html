      <h3>EV32 Receiving the Father's Love: Good News for Honor/Shame Cultures </h3>

      <p><i>Eva Liu Glick, Katie Rawson</i></p>

      <h3>EV28 Making Disciples: From Skeptics to World-Changers</h3>
      <p>Jesus doesn't command us to merely make converts, but to make disciples (Matthew 28:18-20). Still, how do you go about doing that these days? Drawing from seventeen years of ministry to college students, this seminar will explore the motivations of different generations, and provide a simple, yet compelling, model for evangelism, discipleship and leadership development today.</p>
      <p><i>James Choung</i></p>
    </div>

    <div class='seminar'>

      <p><i>Aaron Trank</i></p>
    </div>

    <div class='seminar'>
      <h3>EV25 Creative Campus Activism</h3>
      <p>How do you empower others to join you in acting on the issues that you're passionate about? In this interactive seminar, we'll explore how to use creative activism and experiential campaigns to bring issues to life, change hearts, tell stories, and inspire others to act.</p>
      <p><i>James Pedrick, Scott Erickson</i></p>
    </div>

    <div class='seminar'>
      <h3>EV23 Starting a Cross-Cultural Evangelistic Bible Study</h3>
      <p>God has put Christians in North American universities in a unique position to engage in cross cultural missions through starting evangelistic cross-cultural Bible studies with students from restricted and closed parts of the world. This seminar will challenge you as you consider starting a group on your campus and will give you practical tools to begin and lead a study.</p>
      <p><i>Allison Schafer, Brian Smith</i></p>
    </div>

    <div class='seminar'>
      <h3>EV22 Reaching International Students on Campus</h3>
      <p>More than 700,000 international students now study in the United States, and the number continues to increase each year. How can we engage with these cultures on our campuses? This session includes practical advice on welcoming, loving and reaching international students for Jesus.</p>
      <p><i>Adri Fonteijn, Jovin Adjeitey</i></p>
    </div>

    <div class='seminar'>
      <h3>EV21 Popping the Question Cross-Culturally</h3>

      <p><i>Heidi Kempt Chew</i></p>
    </div>

    <div class='seminar'>
      <h3>EV12 Evangelism through the Gospel of Luke</h3>
      <p>Helping our friends look at Jesus for themselves is one of the best ways to extend God's invitation.  Get trained in turning your Urbana experience in Luke into an evangelistic Bible study.</p>
      <p><i>Andrea Emerson, Rod Pauls</i></p>
    </div>

    <div class='seminar'>
      <h3>EV11 Responding to the New Atheism</h3>
      <p>The "new" atheism of Richard Dawkins, Christopher Hitchens, Daniel Dennett and others has made a huge splash on college campuses, the last decade. In this seminar we will overview the new atheistic worldview and offer practical steps for a Christ-like response.</p>
      <p><i>Rick Mattson</i></p>
    </div>



    <h1 class='title' id='rg'> Ready to Go </h1>
    <div class='seminar'>
      <h3>RG51 A New Kind of Missionary: Using Your Degree and Serving Globally</h3>
      <p>In today's globalized world, there's a need for a new kind of missionary - recent grads with marketplace skills who go for two years to serve alongside long-term teams and projects.  We'll answer questions like "What about my student loans?" and "Do I need to be called?"  You'll learn why your 20s is the best time to be a mid-term goer, how to overcome the five biggest barriers and how to take your first step.</p>
      <p><i>Paul Van Der Werf</i></p>
    </div>

    <div class='seminar'>
      <h3>RG41 Fund Raising as Ministry</h3>
      <p>Rooted in Luke 10, this provides a biblical basis for raising funds that moves beyond "permission" to raise money to the reality that the donor's response to the missionary impacts their eternity as much as the people the missionary serves while in the field.  From this theological foundation, Jon will provide practical tools for both securing support and growing deeper in Jesus as you move through the fund raising process.</p>
